**Note:**  
- `yt_dlp` is the only third-party package; all others are part of Python's standard library.
- If you run this code, it will automatically install `yt-dlp` using pip if it's not already installed.  
- All `tkinter` submodules are part of the `tkinter` package, which is included with standard Python installations (but requires Tk installed on your system).

Let me know if you need more details about any of these packages or their usage!
